# Banking-Transaction-Fraud-Analysis
With the rapid growth of digital banking, UPI payments, online transfers, and card transactions, financial fraud has also increased significantly. Banks today face challenges in identifying suspicious activities such as phishing, card skimming, fake loan apps, and unauthorized transfers.

This project was built to understand how fraud detection works in real banking systems using SQL and structured data analysis.

I designed a complete banking database system that simulates real-world banking operations — including customers, accounts, merchants, transactions, and fraud cases. The goal was not just to store data, but to analyze patterns and identify high-risk behavior.
